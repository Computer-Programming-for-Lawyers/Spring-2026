    "##### Libraries: Beyond Built-in Functions\n",
    "- Python is **extensible**, allowing us to use or create bundles of code called **libraries**.\n",
    "- Libraries (also called \"modules\" or \"packages\") let us:\n",
    "  - Avoid writing code from scratch.\n",
    "  - Use well-tested, reusable code.\n",
    "- **Abstraction**: We don’t need to understand how a library works—just how to use it.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Standard Libraries\n",
    "- When you install Python, it includes **standard libraries** for common tasks.\n",
    "- Standard libraries are not built-in like print() or len(), so they require the import command.\n",
    "- To use a library, you must first **import** it. Example: `import random`\n",
    "- Sometimes, you also need to **install** libraries before you can import them. You would do this in the terminal with the command: `pip install [library name]`\n",

    "##### Creating your own libraries\n",
    "You can import your own Python (.py) files just like libraries, we'll learn more about this later in the semester."
